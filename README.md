## Auto Referee

UCB Coding First Group Project

Our project, Auto-Referee, is a webpage that helps its users understand the rules of the sport they are watching or want to play. Our page has three main parts: a header, a gallery, and the description area where one can learn about the different rules of a given sport. Each sport has its own description of goals, basic rules and scorings. The buttons on the page takes the user to the informations they need. The app retrieves game scheduler from web API based on selected dates.  The user can search for game schedules, teams, and some information about payers of specific teams.

The header has the title and a brief description of the page. It also has a list of teams, that when one is selected, the team's players are listed. 

![tiles](./assets/images/Gallery-image.png)
The gallery is an array of tiles that will display a sport's information or hide it when clicked on (this is done with a toggle function). 

![sports_description](./assets/images/Golf-scoring.png)
Each section of sports' information has buttons on the left hand side named Goals, Basics, and Scoring, referring to each section of information for each sport. These buttons also toggle the sections in question, and so each section will appear or disappear depending on their toggle status.
