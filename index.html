                                </ul>
                            </div>

                                <p>These are the basics of Baseball:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>There are two teams of at least nine players. These teams will either be batting
                                        or playing the field.</li>
                                    <li>The game is divided into nine innings. Each inning is split into the "top of the
                                        inning" and the "bottom of the inning", giving both teams the chance to bat and
                                        defend during each half of the inning. Should the two teams be tied at the end
                                        of the nine innings, the teams will play extra innings until one of them wins.
                                        The ninth inning can be cut short if the home team is winning and that the
                                        visitors were unable to gain a lead in the first half of that final inning.</li>
                                    <li>There are four bases: first, second, third, and home, and they make up a
                                        baseball diamond. There is also an outfield, split into left, center, and right
                                        field, that is positioned behind the baseball diamond.</li>
                                    <li>The nine fielding positions are: pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second
                                        baseman, shortstop, third baseman, right field, center field, and left field.
                                        These all work together on defense to prevent the batting team from scoring
                                        runs.</li>
                                    <li>The batting team will bat until they have three "outs". A batter can strikeout
                                        if they miss three good pitches from the pitcher. If a fielder catches a ball
                                        before it hits the ground, the batter that hit it will be considered out. If a
                                        runner is tagged with a ball without being on base, they are out. If a base
                                        runner passes another out of order, they are out. If a runner runs without
                                        tagging up (or touching the base they started on) after a hit ball has been
                                        caught, and a fielder tags the base with the ball in their hand, they are out.
                                        If a fielder tags a base where a runner is forced to run to before the runner
                                        gets there, the runner is out.</li>
                                    <li>The Pitcher throws the ball into the batter's "strike zone", which is between
                                        the batter's armpits and knees in height, and covers homeplate in length and
                                        width. A pitcher is allowed three balls (outside pitches), and a batter must be
                                        able to get a hit without getting three strikes. A fourth ball pitched will give
                                        the batter a free walk to first base, and a third strike will cause the batter
                                        to be out. A strike is a good pitch that was not hit by the batter. A batter can
                                        also hit a foul, which is a ball hit too far to the left or right of the
                                        baseball diamond, and thus out of bounds. Fielders can catch a foul ball to get
                                        a batter out. If uncaught, batters can hit as many fouls as possible without
                                        getting out. </li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>A field goal in football is worth 3-points.</li>
                                    <li>After a touchdown is scored the offense is given the option to score more:</li>
                                    <li>Kicking through the uprights results in 1-point.</li>
                                    <li>Advancing into the end zone again results in 2-points.</li>
                                    <li>There are two circumstances that the defense can score:</li>
                                    <li>Tackling an offensive player in their own end zone which results in a safety and
                                        2-points</li>
                                    <li>A defensive player catching a ball thrown by an offensive player or picking up a
                                        ball dropped by an offensive player results in a turnover. If the defensive
                                        player runs it into the endzone the result is a touchdown.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>The game is divided into four quarters with a break after two quarters known as
                                        half-time. If the game is tied at the end of four quarters there is an overtime
                                        period equal to one quarter. The game ends when someone from either team scores
                                        a touchdown. If the offense scores a field goal in overtime, the opposing team
                                        is given one chance to score or they lose.</li>
                                    <li>The Offense is tasked with advancing the ball downfield toward the end zone by
                                        running the ball or throwing the ball to a teammate. Play ends when the player
                                        holding the ball is tackled.</li>
                                    <li>The Defense is tasked with stopping the offensive player from advancing by
                                        tackling them.</li>
                                    <li>Downs are the most fundamental part of NFL play. The offense has four downs to
                                        advance the ball 10 yards or the opposing offense takes over automatically.
                                        Advancing 10 yards earns the reset the number of downs to one.</li>
                                    <li>The Offense can also end their possession by either attempting a field goal or
                                        kicking the ball to the other team in what is known as Punting.</li>

                                    <li>After a touchdown is scored the offense is given the option to score more:</li>
                                    <li>Kicking through the uprights results in 1-point.</li>
                                    <li>Advancing into the end zone again results in 2-points.</li>
                                    <li>There are two circumstances that the defense can score:</li>
                                    <li>Tackling an offensive player in their own end zone which results in a safety and
                                        2-points</li>
                                    <li>A defensive player catching a ball thrown by an offensive player or picking up a
                                        ball dropped by an offensive player results in a turnover. If the defensive
                                        player runs it into the endzone the result is a touchdown.</li>

                                    <li>Tennis is a sport that involves 2 or 4 players, 2 against 2 or a double match.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The tennis court is divided into 2 halves by a net 0.914 meters high in the
                                        center and 1.07 meters high on the ends.</li>
                                    <li>The tennis court can be clay, grass, concrete or synthetic material, outdoors or
                                        indoors.</li>
                                    <li>The game starts with a coin toss to determine which player must serve first and
                                        which side they want to serve from.</li>
                                    <li>The server must then serve each point from alternative sides on the baseline.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>At no point must the server's feet move in front of the baseline on the court
                                        prior to hitting their serve. If the server clips the net but the ball goes in
                                        the service area still then 'let' is called and they get to take that serve
                                        again without penalty.</li>
                                    <li>Let' is often called when a point has been interrupted in some way. If the ball
                                        hits the net and fails to go in the service area then out is called and they
                                        lose that serve.</li>
                                    <li>The receiver may stand where they wish upon receipt of the serve. If the ball is
                                        struck without the serve bouncing then the server will receive the point. Once a
                                        serve has been made the amount of shots between the players can be unlimited.
                                    </li>

                                        scoring areas. Points are awarded in scores of 15, 30 and 40. 15 represents 1

                                    <li>You need 4 points to win a game. If a game lands on 40-40 it's known as deuce.

                                    <li>The final set will not have a tie break and requires players to win by two games

                                    <li>If a player touches the net, distracts his opponent or impedes in any way then

                                <ul class="content has-text-white">
                                    <li>You're not supposed to substitute another during the play of a hole.</li>
                                    <li>If you have any questions you can't answer during that hole, play a second ball,
                                        scoring that one as well, until you can come into the clubhouse and ask the
                                        correct ruling on that hole.</li>
                                    <li>A stroke is a forward movement of the club made with the intention of striking
                                        the ball. Intention is the key word here.</li>
                                    <li>If you voluntarily stop your forward stroke halfway down, it's not a stroke,
                                        because your intention died.</li>
                                    <li>If you go through with the swing it's a stroke, even if you miss the ball.</li>
                                    <li>There is no penalty if a ball falls or is nudged off a tee before the forward
                                        stroke begins. Also you can't push, scrape or "spoon" the ball.</li>
                                    <li> There has to be a back swing, no matter how short, and a forward swing.</li>
                                    <li>There are two kinds of hazards. They are water hazards and a bunker. Water
                                        hazards can be a lake, pond, river, stream or whatever that lies in your path to
                                        the green and are marked by red lines or stakes. You have to hit your ball over
                                        it. If you don't do that and your ball drowns, you must drop a ball keeping that
                                        point between the hole and where you drop the ball.</li>
                                    <li>The other hazard is a bunker or the sand trap. You don't have to drop out of it
                                        and take a penalty, but you have to play out of it. The basic rule here is that,
                                        as in a water hazard, you can't touch the sand with your club before you make
                                        the stroke.</li>
                                    <li>Out of bounds areas are usually defined by white stakes, sometimes by a line on
                                        the ground and sometimes by a fence or wall. The entire ball must lie out of
                                        bounds.</li>
                                </ul>
